= Redmine-Plugin: XML-Task-Importer MS Project
== Requirements 
Redmine 2.x, 3.x, 4.x

== What you get:
The plugin creates one root-ticket (task) into te current project, which holds the other (sub)tasks as subtickets.

Right now the plugin only imports tasks from the XML-file. If the resources are persons it tries to match them with registered redmine users. If no matching user is found, a warning is produced, but the import is still possible â€“ in this case the resulting ticket will not have an owner.

== What is imported: 
Task.Name, start_date, finish_date, create_date, duration, done_ratio, priority, predecessor, notes


== Installation
1) go to `{REDMINE_ROOT}/plugin` directory.

2) Install:
  git clone https://github.com/braini75/msproject_import.git
  RAILS_ENV=production rake redmine:plugins:migrate
3) Restart the redmine service. E.g. 
  service apache2 restart
4) enjoy!


== Usage

1. Export your MS Project data to XML
2. access a redmine project, then click "MS Project Import" tab (Make sure you gave permission to the current user).
